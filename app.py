    You will find each functions either in the library or in the main script. Feel free to modu
    - **App Header:** The function `display_app_header` defines the title and a brief description of the app, setting the context for the user. This function is displayed at the top of the app when called on line 24.
       
    - **API Key Check:** The `key_check` function is invoked to ensure the necessary API keys are present before proceeding. This might be for authentication or to access certain services.
    
    - **Data Upload and Display:** The app provides the user with an option to upload data using the `get_data` function (line 47). Once the data is uploaded, it's optionally displayed in an expandable section for the user to review.
    
    - **OpenAI Query Handling:** If the uploaded data is not empty, the `handle_openai_query` function is called (line 64) to process the user's prompt regarding the data and visualize it accordingly. If the uploaded data is empty, a warning is displayed to the user.
